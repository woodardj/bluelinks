Have a bugfix or want to play around with the code?
Here are Google's instructions for loading up a Chrome extension in development mode:

Load the extension unpackaged in developer mode:

From http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/getstarted.html

Bring up the extensions management page by clicking the wrench icon   and choosing Tools > Extensions.
If Developer mode has a + by it, click the + to add developer information to the page. The + changes to a -, and more buttons and information appear.
Click the Load unpacked extension button. A file dialog appears.
In the file dialog, navigate to your extension's folder and click OK.
If your extension is valid, its icon appears next to the address bar, and information about the extension appears in the extensions page, as the following screenshot shows.
